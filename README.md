# Apple-Eater
The game was initially designed for a programming competition. Personally, I used this game to improve my knowledge and application of arrays.

### Aim
- The aim of this game to eat the apple, before it hits the floor
- The user should not touch the edge of the of the screen or the game is over
- If all the apples are consumed the game is won
